** Blog App **

A simple full-stack blogging application built using the MERN stack.
Users can register, log in, create, edit, and delete their own blog posts. Public users can view all blogs and read individual posts. Session is maintained using JWT Authentification.

** Tech Stack **

Frontend: React (with Context API, React Router, Axios)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
Auth: JWT-based authentication
Styling: CSS

** Architecture Overview **

-- Frontend (React)

- Handles routing using React Router.
- Uses Context API to store and persist authentication status (synced with localStorage).
- Axios is used for API calls to the Express backend.
- Protected routes are wrapped in a custom <ProtectedRoute> component.

-- Backend (Express + MongoDB)

- REST API with JWT authentication middleware.
- Mongoose schema for users and posts.
- Middleware for auth checks and owner-only access to posts.

** SetUp Instructions **

-- Clone repo
-- in blogs-BE create .env and put these fields:
DB_CONNECTION_SECRET and JWT_SECRET_KEY
-- run npm i or npm install to install node_modules
-- use npm start to run backend

-- now open folder blogs-FE
-- run npm i
-- enter command npm run dev to run the project
